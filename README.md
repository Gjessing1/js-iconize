# JS Iconize Plugin for Obsidian
A simple plugin to add emoji or Lucide icons to your files and folders in Obsidian, helping you visually organize your vault.

## Features
- **File & Folder Icons**: Assign icons to any file or folder.
- **Lucide Icon Library**: Access and search all of Obsidian's built-in Lucide icons by name.
- **Emoji Support**: Use any emoji as an icon.
- **Integrated Icon Picker**: A single, clean interface for finding the perfect icon.
    - Unified search for both emojis and Lucide icons.
    - A "Recently used" list for quick access to your favorite icons.
    - Guidance on using your computer's native emoji picker for a complete and up-to-date selection.
- **Simple Management**: Easily change or remove an icon at any time.

## How to Use
1.  In the file explorer, **right-click** on the file or folder you want to add an icon to.
2.  Select **"Change icon"** from the context menu. The icon picker will open.
3.  In the picker, you have a few options:
    - **Search**: Type a name or keyword like "book", "calendar", or "smile". The results will show matching Lucide icons and emojis.
    - **Use Native Emoji Picker**: For access to *all* emojis available on your system (including different skin tones), press the native emoji shortcut (`Windows Key + .` on Windows, or `Control + Command + Space` on macOS) and select your emoji.
    - **Select a Recent Icon**: Click on any icon in the "Recently used" section.
4.  Click the icon you want, and it will be applied instantly.

### Removing an Icon
To remove an icon, simply right-click the file/folder, select "Change icon", and click the **"Remove Icon"** button in the picker.

## Settings
The plugin settings page currently has only one option:
- **Clear recent icons**: This button will clear the list of recently used icons that is displayed at the top of the icon picker.
